# Bilgewater Randoms

### We entertain you while we entertain ourselves

Created for the Riot Games API Challenge 2.0. 

We basically ran out of time due to our conflicting work schedules, but we are proud of our mishmad/haphazzard result.
In the meantime we decided to focus on the brawler minions themselves and how their interactions helped to win games (or in our cases, lose them).

#### Everything basically starts by pressing the reroll button at the bottom of the page
Through trial and error of clicking the icons throughout the page, you will be able to do the following:

 + Average number of Brawlers per game
 + A Brawler's win ratio
 + Red's win ratio
 + Blue's win ratio

You'll first start off with the data from just one single measly game, but as you keep on clicking that **reroll** button, more and more games are added.
It's like cookie clicker but with league data.

Currently we only are taking data from NA games. (We might change it in the future depending on how internationally diverse we feel.)
