I made my changes to brents_test.1.html
It runs a script that goes over the first 4 matches and grabs the data from riot
every .85 seconds.

It prints to screen in a JSON object format with a leading comma that needs to be deleted.
Using just the 4 test values makes a file too large to edit on cloud 9. I don't know if my
printing method, appending on an existing element, will work properly with all 10k matches
The timing should be fine and should not cause rejects from riot servers

*********************8/31*********************
Created new main.html with empty functions atm to change backgrounds and other things depending on which minion is clicked.
Also changed README in here to be the same as the old one.

When clicking on the minion icon, the fuction do(insert minion) is run. Currently only changes the title at the top of the page
